<h1>Random Quote</h1>
<p>a basic web page which selects a random quote from an array.</br>
The quote is displayed on the page along with a tweet button so you can tweet this quote</br>
When the teweet button is clicked a "tweet" window opens prepopulated with the quote from the page</p>

a codepen version is here:

<p>Nice to have:</p>
<li>add the twitter bird icon to the tweet button</li>
<li>add more quotes</li>
<li>create game by asking user to specify the movie the quote came from and the character who said it</li>
