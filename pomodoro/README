This is a basic pomodoro clock.

on page load, enable short session, long session, and plus button
short session sets timer to 5min, long session sets timer to 25min, plus/minus buttons add/subtract 1min
can't subtract if timer is set to zero, can't add more than 59min
start button works only if timer is < zero
stop works only after start
reset works only after stop and sets timer to last value before clicking start
